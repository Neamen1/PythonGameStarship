# PythonGameStarship
This is a game on Python using tkinter library (and Pillow lib for image processing) created by me during one of the courses I attended. 

The idea is that you and your friend must defend yourself agains unlimited waves of enemies starships. Sometimes they can get close enought to you, so you will have to backup and use the money collected from enemies to upgrade your ship and try again with new opportunities.
